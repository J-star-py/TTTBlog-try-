                Hello! My name is Joaquín. I’m the creator of this website and
                the author of the articles in the blog.
              </p>

          <div id="threeReasons">
            <p id="threeReasonsIntro">
              I started this blog with mainly 3
              <span style="text-wrap: nowrap">things in mind</span>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li id="li1">
                <h2>1. Practice web development</h2>
                <p>
                  I've been studying programming and web development for a
                  while, and this is the first website I've created. I built it
                  to practice what I've been studying and to gain hands-on
                  experience. Working on it has helped me improve my skills not
                  just in programming, but also in design and many other related
                  areas.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li id="li2">
                <h2>2. Share my work</h2>
                <p>
                  I’ve worked on diverse projects, often keeping them to myself.
                  However, the times I shared some of the work I have put effort
                  into, I realized how cool it is to come across people that are
                  interested on it, find it valuable, or that have worked on
                  similar projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I thought a blog would be a good place to start sharing more
                  of my work, the process I’ve gone through and the information
                  I have gathered. Having a blog would also give me the
                  opportunity to improve my writing abilities, which is
                  something I’m interested in.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Learn about the world of online businesses</h2>
                <p>
                  I aspire to set up an online business in the future. Having my
                  own website gives me the chance to practice and experiment
                  with things like content creation, traffic, marketing,
                  advertising, and more. With that, I can acquire useful
                  knowledge for my future endeavors in the world of online
                  businesses.

            <h2>Why Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>
            <p>
              chose Tic-tac-toe as the main theme of the website and the blog
              for various reasons. Firstly, I have previously worked on projects
              related to this game, so I have already gathered some interesting
              information about it. Secondly, I like that it is a simple game.
              Because it is simple, analyzing it and looking into its logic is
              easier than with other more complex games. Lastly, it is a widely
              known game, which is nice to connect with more people.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of that, in addition to my general interest in patterns and
              logical things, made me believe Tic-tac-toe would be a great
              option of a topic to start my first blog.

          something interesting, valuable or entertaining.
